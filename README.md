# Next.js + Supabase Authentication Demo

A production-style authentication system built with **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Tailwind CSS**, demonstrating protected routes and role-based access control (user / admin).

This project showcases real-world auth patterns commonly used in SaaS applications.
